# wave-elliptic
Uses Dr. Pretorius' PAMR and AMRD code to solve the wave equation in cylindrical coordinates. This is used as a source for Poisson's equation in Cartesian coordinates. When adaptive mesh refinement is used  or the problem is split up over several processors, the MG variables become non-smooth at the refinement boundaries. It should be noted that the wave equation is not coupled to the potential field; it only sources it.
