Hey Matt, I think I've got most of the stuff worked out, but I would still 
like to talk to you tomorrow. This email is basically a copy of the 
readme document located at /d/bh1/home3/gdreid/wave_elip_amr_matt.

The example in this folder solves the wave equation in cylindrical 
coordinates:

diff(f,t)   = f_t,
diff(f_t,t) = 1/r diff(r*diff(f,r),r) + diff(f,z$2),

with Neumann BCs on the r=0 boundary and Dirichlet BCs elsewhere.

Additionally it solves the elliptic problem:

diff(psi_t0,r$2) + diff(psi_t0,r$2) - f*f = 0

with Neumann BCs on the r=0 boundary and Dirichlet BCs elsewhere.

It seems that the main issues were several fold and all acted to 
contribute to the same sorts of errors. First off, I forgot to list 
psi_t0 in the interp_AMR_bdy_vars. This seems to have lead to the 
boundaries not syncing properly? Secondly, there was the issue
where PAMR was returning the grid spacing for the finest grid in 
the MG hierarchy rather than the spacing for the current grid.
Finally, and most insidiously, I forgot that FORTRAN is particular
about floating point numbers and was inadvertently casting all of
my boundary equations to single precision by saying things like
0.1*psi_t0(i,j) rather than 0.1D0*psi_t0(i,j). This was preventing
the equations form converging properly on the boundaries.

Anyway, with these things fixed, stuff looks a lot better. I am
no longer getting big spikes on the boundaries. However when I
take the second derivatives of psi_t0 in DV, the boundaries are 
clearly visible and small spikes still appear. Any help smoothing 
those out would be greatly appreciated.

I have left example sdf files in the example directory
